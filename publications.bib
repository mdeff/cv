* Can be uploaded to ORCID.
* Should serve to generate list on website (with button to get bibtex entry).
* Can be used for a latex CV.

todo:
* point url to code? (paper is hyperlinked with biblatex eprint=true)
* how to list recognition? (e.g., spotlight, best paper, citations?)
	* better to list in Awards
